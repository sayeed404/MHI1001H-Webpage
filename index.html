		<h1>My Thoughts</h1>
		<p>
			Ducks are awesome, how come I never see them during Christmas?<br/>
		</p>
		<h2>My Subconscious Thoughts</h2>
		<p>
			Ducks are too cheerful to not celebrate Christmas.<br/>
			They must travel to the North Pole...<br/>
			I wonder if they wear hats during the holidays?<br/>
